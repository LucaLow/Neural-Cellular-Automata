# Neural-Cellular-Automata
This project involves the creation of a cellular automata model trained using neural networks, which will be hosted online.

## Resources
This project is currently using the Notion platform to document project progress and important information. This Notion workspace will be made public at a later point in time.

However, some useful resources for this project include:
- Understanding Cellular Automata (CA)
