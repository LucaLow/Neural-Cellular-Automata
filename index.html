      What are Cellular Automata?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Cellular automata are a generalisation of John Conway’s Game of Life. 
      Cells existing in a grid each have a state. Observing only the states of 
      the cells immediately around it, each cell updates its value based on a 
      given rule. The same rule is applied to all cells in the grid. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Different forms of cellular automata arise by changing the rule format, 
      resulting in drastically different (and complex) behaviours. We’ve 
      implemented some famous examples here. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a neural network and more complex states, the cells can be trained 
      to exhibit specific behaviours, and this when it becomes <i>Neural Cellular Automata</i> (NCA). 
      Our project is interested in investigating how we can leverage NCA to make CAs 
      that exhibit organism-like behaviour.
    </p>

    
    <h2>
      Terminology 
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Cell</i>: Cellular automata exist on a grid of cells. Each square of 
      the grid represents is termed a cell, and each cell has its own value 
      representing its state.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Neighbourhood</i>: These are the cells immediately surrounding the 
      target cell that this cell can ‘see’ and use the values from in its 
      decision making. What is included in the neighbourhood can vary from CA 
      to CA (see Larger than Life) however in most models this is usually the 
      cells that are ‘touching’ the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Update cycle</i>: This is when we go through an update all the values 
      of all the cells based on their previous values. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Update rule</i>: This is the rule/decision making process that each 
      cell uses to determine its new value in the next update cycle. Every 
      cell in the grid uses the same rule.
    </p>
    <h2>Neural Cellular Automata (Coming Soon)</h2>
    <p>
      Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) are a category of cellular automata that 
      involves using a neural network as the cell’s update rule. The neural 
      network can be trained to figure out how to update the cell’s value in 
      co-ordination with other cells operating on the same rule to produce a 
      target behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the best examples of NCA is 
      <i><a href="https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/">Growing Neural Cellular Automata</a></i> 
      (A. Mordvintsev et. al, 2020) where they trained a Neural Cellular Automata to ‘grow’ into 
      a target image from a single seed cell. (Highly recommend looking at the 
      paper, they have an interactive version of the result that’s really cool!). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Neural Cellular Automata is displays properties that can be likened to how cells 
      communicate and co-ordinate within living organisms. The model from Growing 
      Neural Cellular Automata also naturally showed regenerative properties, i.e. 
      when the pattern was disturbed during development, so long as the disturbance 
      was not too drastic, the model was able to recover.

    <h2>John Conway’s Game of Life / THE Game of Life</h2>
    <div class="sideBySide">
      <div>
        <p>
          This is probably the most famous example of cellular automata there is.
        </p> 
        <p>
          The Game of Life operates on these very simple rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>All cells are either alive or dead (1 or 0).</li>
          <li>When a cell that is living has 2 or 3 neighbours, it gets to live (the cell survives). </li>
          <li>When a cell that is dead has 3 neighbours, it comes to life (a cell is born). </li>
          <li>In all other circumstances, the cell dies/remains dead.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Even this simple rule can produce some very complex and interesting 
          behaviours, and many patterns have been discovered that are 
          self-sustaining. A more sophisticated version of the Game of Life 
          can be found <a href="https://playgameoflife.com/">here</a>.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Life Like Cellular Automata</h2>
        <p>
          Life like CA operate very similarly to the Game of Life in that all cells
          are either alive or dead. However, Life Like gives you the freedom to 
          choose how many cells must be alive in the neighbourhood to either 
          survive or be born. This is specified by a <b>rule string</b>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The rule string format we have used is <b>survival/birth notation.</b> In
          this notation, the original Game of Life would be expressed as <b>23/3</b> (we 
          don’t worry about spacing between numbers because they can only be the 
          numbers 0-8), where 2 or 3 cells in the neighbourhood are required for 
          survival of a living cell, and 3 cells in the neighbourhood are required 
          for a dead cell to come to life/be born.
        </p>

        <h2>Larger than Life</h2>
        <p>
          Larger than Life builds on Life Like CA by introducing even more flexibility. 
          This means the following are now specifieable in the rule string:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The neighbourhood radius to encompass cells that are further than one
            cell away.</li>
          <li>Neighbourhood shape.</li>
          <li>Minimum lifespan of living cells (basically living cells have HP that
            is deducted from every time it’s exposed to death conditions)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Continuous Cellular Automata</h2>
    <p>
      Continuous CA also builds on Life Like CA. Continuous CA can display 
      behaviours similar to basic organisms and population level behaviours of 
      bacteria etc. that have simple behavioural patterns. The main difference 
      is that instead of using the binary dead or alive as states, we use a 
      continuous range of values. The new cell state value is calculated in 
      the following way:
